# Coffee Quality Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing coffee quality metrics and trends using Power BI. The dataset includes various coffee attributes such as flavor profiles, bean types, regions, and other quality factors. The analysis aimed to uncover patterns and trends related to coffee quality, which can inform business decisions in the coffee industry.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to:
- Analyze and visualize coffee quality across different regions and types.
- Identify trends in coffee flavor profiles based on various attributes like region and bean type.
- Create detailed reports in Power BI to present the findings.

## Data Source

The data used in this project includes various metrics related to coffee quality, such as:
- **Region**: The geographical region where the coffee beans were sourced.
- **Bean Type**: The type of coffee beans (e.g., Arabica, Robusta).
- **Flavor Profile**: Ratings for various taste aspects such as acidity, bitterness, and sweetness.
- **Quality Score**: Overall quality rating assigned to the coffee.

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **Power BI**: For data visualization and report creation.
  - Features Used: Power Query, DAX, Visualizations (Bar Charts, Pie Charts, Maps)
  
## Key Insights & Analysis

1. **Coffee Quality by Region**: 
   - Analyzed the quality scores of coffee beans sourced from different regions, identifying trends in higher-quality beans from specific areas.

2. **Flavor Profile Analysis**: 
   - Compared the flavor profiles of different bean types, helping to understand how various attributes (e.g., acidity, bitterness) contribute to the overall quality.

3. **Trend Analysis**: 
   - Visualized quality trends over time to identify any seasonal or market-driven shifts in coffee quality.

## Reports and Visualizations

- **Coffee Quality by Region**: A bar chart or map showing the quality scores of coffee beans by region.
- **Flavor Profile Breakdown**: Pie charts or stacked bar charts displaying the composition of flavor ratings for different coffee beans.
- **Quality Trends**: Line or area charts showing the trend of coffee quality over time, based on available data.

## Getting Started
